# [Container With Most Water](https://leetcode.com/problems/container-with-most-water/)

You are given an integer array height of length n. There are n vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the ith line are (i, 0) and (i, height[i]).

Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.

Notice that you may not slant the container.

**Example 1:**

![img.png](img.png)

- Input: height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
- Output: 49
- Explanation: The above vertical lines are represented by array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]. In this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is 49.

**Example 2:**

- Input: height = [1,1]
- Output: 1

**Constraints:**

- n == height.length
- 2 <= n <= 105
- 0 <= height[i] <= 104

```agsl
// time: O(n)  space: O(1)
public int maxArea(int[] height) {
    int max_area=0,low=0,high=height.length-1;
    while(low<high){
        max_area = Math.max(max_area, (high-low)*Math.min(height[low],height[high]));
        if(height[low]<height[high]) ++low;
        else --high;
    }
    return max_area;
}
```
**Optimization**

While we are moving bars closer(left and right move closer) if next bar is equal or less than current then the area isnâ€™t gonna be bigger(because bars are closer so they better be higher to have bigger area), 
so we can keep moving the left and right until a bigger value appears.

```agsl
// time: O(n)  space: O(1)
public int maxArea(int[] height) {
  int max_area=0,left=0,right=height.length-1;
  while(left<right){
      int minHeight = Math.min(height[left],height[right]);
      max_area = Math.max(max_area, (right-left)*minHeight);
//if next bar is equal or less than current then area isn't gonna be bigger. 
      while(height[left]<= minHeight && left<right) left++;
      while(height[right]<= minHeight && left<right) right--;
  }
  return max_area;
}
```
